尊敬的教授们，非常荣幸能够参加面试

我是董闯闯，21岁，将在今年6月份毕业

通过学习和阅读书籍，我发现自己喜欢上了计算机专业。与此同时，我也意识到我所学的还远远不够，所以我选择继续深造，获得硕士学位。

在大学四年里，我一直努力学习，绩点3.26.此外，我积极参加学科竞赛，如数学竞赛、程序设计竞赛等。我最大的优点就是在解决棘手问题时的自学能力，例如，当我遇到一个棘手的技术问题时，我不会一开始就寻求他人的帮助，而是利用所有现有的相关工具（例如Google或图书馆中的书籍）来解决该问题。此外，我善于分析，负责任，可靠，办事效率高。 如果您能给我继续深造的机会，我将不胜感激。

Dear professors,it is my great honor to have this interview. My name is Dong Chuangchuang. I am 21 years old and I will graduate in June this year. 

Through studying and reading books, I found that I liked the computer major. At the same time, I also realize that what I have learned is far from enough, so I choose to continue my study and get a master's degree.

During my four years in college, I studied hard and got a 3.26 GPA. In addition, I actively participate in discipline competitions, such as math competition, program design competition and so on. My greatest strength is my self-learning ability to solve difficult problems，for example,when I have a difficult technical problem, I don't start by asking for help, but instead use all the relevant tools available (such as Google or books in the library) to solve the problem. In addition, I am analytical, responsible, reliable and efficient. I would appreciate it very much if you could give me a chance to further my study.

that's all,thanks for your attention
